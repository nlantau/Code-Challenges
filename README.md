# General
A quite chaotic structure of in this repository. I use these challenges to explore
new languages, paradigms, algorithms and data structures. 
I'm into learning new approaches and ways of solving problems. A problem can many times be
solved using several different approaches. This fascinates me quite a lot.
I'm taught the imperative and procedural way of program, and object-oriented programming. 
I find functional programming and array programming as two very intersting paradigms, where
Haskell and APL are my favorites (don't ask me anything about APL though. I'm very new to this).

## CodeWars
Often quick and dirty solutions.
Overall: 4 kyu/30.4%

## AoC
Super fun December challenge that I never really have time to complete.
I started doing them in 2019 (when I started programming) in Java.
Continued with 2020 in Python.
... and managaged a couple of days in Rust in 2021.

Hopefully, I'll get more free time in upcoming AoC when I'm not a student any more.

## LeetCode
These solutions are more carefully structured, where primarily time complexity
is my main concern.
