# Graph Therory for Datastructures & Algorithms

## Traversal
+ Depth First: uses stack
+ Breadth First: uses queue

## Datastructure
Adjecency list (ie hashmap of lists)


### DFT - Algo
+ Initialize stack with first node
+ while stack:
+ Pop stack (current node, print it)
+ Push current node's neighbors to the stack

### BFT - Algo
+ Initialize queue with first node
+ while queue
+ deque (current node, print it)
+ enque current node's neighbors
